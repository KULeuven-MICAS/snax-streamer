# Flexible Streamer Generator for SNAX

The Flexible Streamer Generator is built to alleviate the data layout concern of an accelerator. It decouples the the accelerator with the real memory system. It simplifies the data interface of the accelerator. The accelerator doesn't need to consider the complicated request and response to/from the real memory system. The accelerator's data interface is simply a valid-ready decoupled handshake interface. Besides, the pre-fetch mechanism inside the Streamer also helps to relieve the data contention problem.

The Streamer has a compatible interface with the [SNAX core](https://github.com/KULeuven-micas/snitch_cluster) and can be integrated into it as a data streaming engine.

It is written in CHISEL 5.0.0 and is intended to be connected to the SNAX accelerator RISC-V manager core through a SystemVerilog wrapper.

Thanks to the strong expression power of Chisel, the Flexible Streamer Generator has the capability of dealing with any number of temporal loops and any number of parallel loops for data address generation. More importantly, the Streamer generator is accelerator agnostic, highly flexible, and parameterizable which means it is suitable for a wide range of accelerators employing a [tiled-strided-layout](https://github.com/KULeuven-MICAS/snax-mlir/tree/main/compiler/ir/tsl). We have generated Streamers for three accelerators, including the SNAX-GEMM, SNAX-PostProcessing-SIMD, and MAC Engine.

## Microarchitecture
The figure below shows the microarchitecture of the Flexible Streamer Generator.

The main module of the Streamer is the data mover.  It includes the data reader (reads data from the real memory system and acts as the producer for the accelerator), and the data writer (writes data to the real memory system and acts as the consumer for the accelerator). Each data mover has its address generation unit and works independently so that each data mover can do data transfers as quickly as possible.

The data reader gives read requests to the memory system (the address, and read signal, etc.) and gets the response. When all the responses of one transaction are obtained, it pushes the valid data into a FIFO for the accelerator to consume. If the accelerator is consumes the data successfully, the FIFO will pop the data. The data reader will keep getting new data from the real memory system (pre-fetch) until the FIFO is full or all the input data has been fetched.

The data writer obtains valid data from the FIFO output (written by the accelerator) and sends write request to the memory system. When there is a valid output from the accelerator (and the FIFO is not full), the valid output will be pushed to the FIFO. When the FIFO is not empty, the data writer will keep sending write requests. When one write transaction is successful, the data will be pop from the FIFO.

The csrManager of the StreamerTop module manages the CSR read/write operations from the SNAX core (or any external control). The Streamer has its CSRs to store the configuration for the address generation and transaction number, etc. The CsrManager writes CSR configurations such as the temporal loop bound and strides when all the CSR configurations are valid. While there is an ongoing transaction, the CsrManager can accept and buffer the next configuration configuration. When the current transaction finishes, the SNAX core can send the configuration valid signal then the CSRManager loads the CSR values into the Streamer.

### Instantiate Streamer for three accelerators
`StreamerInstanceParameters.scala` lists three Streamer parameter configurations for three different accelerators.

#### Example: Streamer parameter configuration for a simple MAC Engine
```
object MacStreamerParameters extends CommonParams {

  def MacScalingFactor = 4

  def temporalAddrGenUnitParams: TemporalAddrGenUnitParams =
    TemporalAddrGenUnitParams(
      loopDim = 1,
      loopBoundWidth = 8,
      addrWidth
    )

  def fifoReaderParams: Seq[FIFOParams] = Seq(
    FIFOParams(64 * MacScalingFactor, 2),
    FIFOParams(64 * MacScalingFactor, 2),
    FIFOParams(64, 2)
  )

  def fifoWriterParams: Seq[FIFOParams] = Seq(
    FIFOParams(64 * MacScalingFactor, 2)
  )

  def stationarity = Seq(0, 0, 1, 1)

  def dataReaderParams: Seq[DataMoverParams] = Seq(
    DataMoverParams(
      tcdmPortsNum = 1 * MacScalingFactor,
      spatialBounds = Seq(2 * MacScalingFactor),
      spatialDim = 1,
      elementWidth = 32,
      fifoWidth = fifoReaderParams(0).width
    ),
    DataMoverParams(
      tcdmPortsNum = 1 * MacScalingFactor,
      spatialBounds = Seq(2 * MacScalingFactor),
      spatialDim = 1,
      elementWidth = 32,
      fifoWidth = fifoReaderParams(1).width
    ),
    DataMoverParams(
      tcdmPortsNum = 1,
      spatialBounds = Seq(2),
      spatialDim = 1,
      elementWidth = 32,
      fifoWidth = fifoReaderParams(2).width
    )
  )

  def dataWriterParams: Seq[DataMoverParams] = Seq(
    DataMoverParams(
      tcdmPortsNum = 1 * MacScalingFactor,
      spatialBounds = Seq(2 * MacScalingFactor),
      spatialDim = 1,
      elementWidth = 32,
      fifoWidth = fifoWriterParams(0).width
    )
  )

}
```
## Functional description

The access pattern for the Streamer is represented by a set of nested for loops. Every for loop can specify a _stride_ which we use to increment a base pointer. On top of this, some of the for loops can be _spatially unrolled_, to enable parallel data accesses by the accelerator. This splits address generation in two parts, the temporal address generation and spatial address generation. The temporal address is based on the temporal loop counters and the temporal strides configuration. The spatial address is based on the spatial unrolling factor of the accelerator and the spatial strides configuration. The spatial address generation unit will generate a unique address for each data element which is accessed in parallel. As there may be multiple data elements per memory word, these addresses are then merged for proper data alignment with the memory bank width.

We formulate the address generation formula below:
```
for(;;temporalbound_n-1)
 for(;;temporalbound_n-2)
   …
    for(;;temporalbound_0)
     parfor(;;spatialbound_m-1)
      parfor(;;spatialbound_m-2)
       …
        parfor(;;spatialbound_0)
          temporal_address = (temporal_unrolling_loop_counters.zip(tempStride).map { case (a, b) => a * b }).reduce(_ +& _)
          spatial_address = (spatial_unrolling_loop_counters.zip(spatialStride).map { case (a, b) => a * b }).reduce(_ +& _)
          add_o = base_ptr + temporal_address + spatial_address
```

Take a SIMD accelerator as an example (1 temporal loop and 1 spatial loop), Vu = 8, the address generation is:
```
for (ti = 0 to VEC_LEN/Vu – 1):
    parfor (si = 0 to Vu -1):
      addr_o[Vu-1:0] = base_ptr + ti*(tempStride) +  [Vu-1:0]*(spatialStride)
```
Which actually translates to:
```
addr_o[0] = base_ptr + ti*(tempStride) +  [0]*(spatialStride)
addr_o[1] = base_ptr + ti*(tempStride) +  [1]*(spatialStride)
addr_o[2] = base_ptr + ti*(tempStride) +  [2]*(spatialStride)
addr_o[3] = base_ptr + ti*(tempStride) +  [3]*(spatialStride)
addr_o[4] = base_ptr + ti*(tempStride) +  [4]*(spatialStride)
addr_o[5] = base_ptr + ti*(tempStride) +  [5]*(spatialStride)
addr_o[6] = base_ptr + ti*(tempStride) +  [6]*(spatialStride)
addr_o[7] = base_ptr + ti*(tempStride) +  [7]*(spatialStride)
```
Take GEMM Accelerator input data A as an example(3 temporal loop and 2 spatial loop), the address generation is:

```
for (m1 = 0 to M’/Mu-1)
    for (n1 = 0 to N’/Nu-1)
        for (k1 = 0 to K’/Ku-1)
            parfor(0 to Mu)
            parfor(0 to Ku)
              temporal_address = m1*t_str_m1 + n1*t_str_n1 + k1*t_str_k1
              spatial_address = [Mu-1:0]*s_str_m + [Ku-1:0]*str_str_k
              addr_o[Mu-1:0][Ku-1:0] = ptr_o + temporal_address + spatial_address

```
where `t_str_*` - are temporal strides and `s_str_*` - are spatial strides.

Which translates to:
```
addr_o[0][0] = ptr_o + m1*t_str_m1 + n1*t_str_n1 + k1*t_str_k1 + [0]*s_str_m + [0]*str_str_k
addr_o[0][1] = ptr_o + m1*t_str_m1 + n1*t_str_n1 + k1*t_str_k1 + [0]*s_str_m + [1]*str_str_k
addr_o[0][2] = ptr_o + m1*t_str_m1 + n1*t_str_n1 + k1*t_str_k1 + [0]*s_str_m + [2]*str_str_k
…
addr_o[m][k] = ptr_o + m1*t_str_m1 + n1*t_str_n1 + k1*t_str_k1 + [m]*s_str_m + [k]*str_str_k
…
addr_o[Mu-1][Ku-3] = ptr_o + m1*t_str_m1 + n1*t_str_n1 + k1*t_str_k1 + [Mu-1]*s_str_m + [Ku-3]*str_str_k
addr_o[Mu-1][Ku-2] = ptr_o + m1*t_str_m1 + n1*t_str_n1 + k1*t_str_k1 + [Mu-1]*s_str_m + [Ku-2]*str_str_k
addr_o[Mu-1][Ku-1] = ptr_o + m1*t_str_m1 + n1*t_str_n1 + k1*t_str_k1 + [Mu-1]*s_str_m + [Ku-1]*str_str_k
```


## IO ports
The input and output ports of the Streamer are shown in the table below.

The Streamer uses a simplified CSR request/response interface for CSR write/read operation. A more detailed description of the CSR operation interface can be found [here](https://kuleuven-micas.github.io/snitch_cluster/rm/snax_cluster.html).

The Streamer uses a simplified TCDM request/response interface to read and write data from/to the TCDM. A more detailed description of the TCDM request/response interface can be found [here](https://kuleuven-micas.github.io/snitch_cluster/rm/snax_cluster.html).

The Streamer uses the Decoupled interface for accelerator input and output data. A more detailed description of the Decoupled interface can be found [here](https://www.chisel-lang.org/docs/explanations/interfaces-and-connections#the-standard-ready-valid-interface-readyvalidio--decoupled).

The simplified interface for the CSR and TCDM request/response contains the core signals and can be found at `TypeDefine.scala`. The complete signals for the CSR request/response interface and TCDM request/response interface will be added in the SystemVerilog wrapper.
